Notes for version 2025
==================

- different number of pages: C clef has 997 pages vs all others 995 pages - why? => reason: C clef 2 pages more "East St. Louis Toodle - oo" => erronously duplicated at pdf page 858/859 => suggestion: DELETE 2nd occurrence in C clef book?
- songs 2x in book:
  - Rosita (p855/856, "instrumental verse") vs La Rosita (p872/873, "tango") => same?
  - Sister Kate (p190/1) vs  (p348/9) => seem identical: delete version at p348/9?
  - I'm Savin' It All For You (p840 & p864) => ToC mentions "Am I Blue" for p864
- songs missing (but mentioned in ToC):
  - San Sue Strut => different song on p575
- issues in ToC:
  - Big Bad Bill, p852/3 & Jungle Blues, p852/3 => Jungle Blues missing?
  - I'm a Charleston Baby, p838/9 & Jazzin' Down in Hindoo => I am a charleston baby is on p828
  - "Gouge of Armor Avenue, The" 818 vs. "The Gouge of Armor Avenue 818" => 2x in ToC
  - "Tonight you belong to me" => p750 iso p698
  - Are You Lonesome Tonight? => p666 iso p664
  - Clarinet Marmalade p450 => listed 2x, correct is only p944
  - ToC shows Backwoods Blues on p851 => correct is p987 (attention: discrepancy of 2 pages in Bb & Eb, see first point)
  - ToC shows Georgia Lullaby on p966 => but song is Ain't She Sweet
